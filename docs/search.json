A number of other resources, however, are available. An FAQ forum is available on ADAM. The portions of the online sessions involving presentation by the instructor will be recorded and made available after each session on SWITCHtube. Information about the exam is available on the Exam tab on this webpage.\nCourse materials, such as readings or suggested preparation exercises, will be made available about one week before each session. Videos of the online sessions and associated slides will be posted after each session.\nVideo recordings and SWITCHtube\nThe online sessions involving presentation by the instructor will be recorded and made available after each session on SWITCHtube. The instrutor will make efforts to ensure student anonymity and that discussion between the instructor and students is not part of the recorded videos (unless desired by the student). All recordings will be deleted at the end of the semester. According to University of Basel’s regulations these recordings are for personal use only and should not be further distributed in any form.\n\n\n\n",
