# How should you use this website?

This website is designed to help course participants get an overview of the course and access most course materials (e.g., recommended background readings and videos, additional non-mandatory readings). A number of other resources, however, are available. An [FAQ](https://adam.unibas.ch/goto_adam_crs_1230735.html) forum is available on ADAM. Any recordings of the sessions will be made available on [SWITCHtube](https://tube.switch.ch/channels/d4bc1931). Information about the exam is available on the [Exam](exam.html) tab on this webpage.  

Course materials, such as readings or suggested preparation exercises, will be made available about one week before each session. Videos of the online sessions and associated slides will be posted **after** each session. 

# Video recordings and SWITCHtube

Any recordings will be made available after each session on [SWITCHtube](https://tube.switch.ch/channels/d4bc1931). All recordings will be deleted at the end of the semester. According to University of Basel's [regulations](https://www.unibas.ch/dam/jcr:9e482656-e333-42ec-bbd3-4639dedd3dc7/R_Ton-Bildaufnahmen_00.pdf) these **recordings** are for **personal use** only and should **not be further distributed** in any form.
