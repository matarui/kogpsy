### Additional reading: Variability and consistency in language learning

Research on cross-cultural variability and consistency is hot on the scientific agenda of psycholinguistics today. Check out the introduction of the [Wordbank](https://wordbank-book.stanford.edu/intro-theory.html) project (Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, & Marchman, in press) for an overview of current work aiming to describe variability and consistency in language learning.
